Parsing using For loop
----------------------

    # Note: Upon execution of for loop the list in which for is
    # looping over is not a reference to "$@". Rather it's a copy of
    # the list.

    for arg in "$@"
    do

        # Remove one arg from "$@"
        shift

        # Pattern matching
        case "$arg" in

        (-, --)
            # Do not parse any arguments
            break #?
            ;; 

        (*-xyzOpt-*)
            ...
            continue;

        # If needed re-add "$arg" to "$@" (in case they are needed to
        # be passed to sub shell scripts)
        set -- "$@" "$arg"
    done
