Variable Scope in sh
====================

(I'm not quite sure about it)

Unless specified 'local', the variable is visible everywhere in the
current shell environment no matter where it was declared.

The variable can only be visible to sub-shell and child programs with
two ways:

1. Use of 'export'

    export MY_VAR=1
    myprogram # myprogram and all other programs can see it.

2. Set the variable when calling the program

    MY_VAR=1 myprogram # only myprogram can see it.
