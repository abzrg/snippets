JVM, JRE, and JDK
=================

JRE: Java Runtime Environment
JVM: Java Virtual Machine
JDK: Java Development Kit

If you only need to run Java programs on your computer and you
don't need to create or modify Java programs, you want to install
JRE to do so.

It includes:
- Java Standard Library: java.lang, java.util, java.io, java.sql, ...
- JVM: It is responsible for executing the java program. It loads up
  all the bytecode from .class files that are generated by compilation
  of .java files into memory, and runs the program. It
  - does necessary platform specific things,
  - manages memory and garbage collection automatically
  - manages multithreading in case the program uses it,
  - does some builtin security checks

JDK includes everything that you need to create, modify, compile,
debug, test and run Java programs. Tools such as:
- JRE
- javac
- java library source code
- debugger
- jconsole (monitoring tools)
- tools for creating and managing jar files (bundle classes into one
  file to be distributed)
