Project Structure in Java
=========================

"Simple" J2SE projects
----------------------

As cletus explained, source directory structure is directly equivalent
to package structure, and that's essentially built into Java.
Everything else is a bit less clear-cut.

A lot of simple projects are organized by hand, so people get to pick
a structure they feel OK with. What's often done (and this is also
reflected by the structure of projects in Eclipse, a very dominant
Java tool) is to have your source tree begin in a directory called
`src`. Your package-less source files would sit directly in src, and
your package hierarchy, typically starting with a `com` directory,
would likewise be contained in `src`. If you CD to the `src` directory
before firing up the `javac` compiler, your compiled .class files will
end up in the same directory structure, with each .class file sitting
in the same directory and next to its .java file.

If you have a lot of source and class files, you'll want to separate
them out from each other to reduce clutter. Manual and Eclipse
organization often place a `bin` or classes directory parallel to
`src` so the .class files end up in a hierarchy that mirrors that of
`src`.

If your project has a set of `.jar` files to deliver capability from
third-party libraries, then a third directory, typically `lib`, is
placed parallel to `src` and `bin`. Everything in `lib` needs to be
put on the `classpath` for compilation and execution.

Finally, there's a bunch of this and that which is more or less
optional:

- docs in `doc`
- resources in `resources/`
- data in `data/`
- configuration in `conf/`...

You get the idea. The compiler doesn't care about these directories,
they're just ways for you to organize (or confuse) yourself.
