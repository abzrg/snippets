$ git clone -b,--branch develop <remote-url>

  this clones the whole repo and then checks out the `develop`
  branch instead of the default branch. It is simply equivalent to:

  $ git clone <remote-url>
  $ git checkout develop

$ git clone --single-branch --branch develop <remote-url>

  this one however only clones the develop branch, saving network
  traffic and disk space.
