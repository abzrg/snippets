Remove a remote branch
----------------------

    git push <remote_name> --delete/-d <branch_name>
    git push <remote_name> :<branch_name>

>>> From pro git book:

Suppose you’re done with a remote branch — say, you and your
collaborators are finished with a feature and have merged it into your
remote’s main branch (or whatever branch your stable code-line is in).
You can delete a remote branch using the rather obtuse syntax git push
[remotename] :[branch]. If you want to delete your serverfix branch
from the server, you run the following:

    $ git push origin :serverfix
    To git@github.com:schacon/simplegit.git
     - [deleted]         serverfix

Boom. No more branches on your server. You may want to dog-ear this
page, because you’ll need that command, and you’ll likely forget the
syntax. A way to remember this command is by recalling the git push
[remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch] syntax that we went over a
bit earlier. If you leave off the [localbranch] portion, then you’re
basically saying, “Take nothing on my side and make it be
[remotebranch].”
