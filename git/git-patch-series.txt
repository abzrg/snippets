Patch Series
============

1. To generate a patch series:

    git switch feature-branch
    git format-patch <base-branch>
    # or
    git format-patch <base-branch>..<feature-branch>

This produces files like:

    0001-fix-bug.patch
    0002-add-feature.patch
    0003-update-docs.patch
    ...

2. To apply patch series:

    # git-am is recommended for patch emails
    git am /path/to/patches/.*patch

NOTE:
    1. Make sure you are on the branch where you want the commits
       applied.
    2. If a conflict occurs during git am, Git will stop and let you
       resolve it. After resolving:

        git am --continue

       To abort series:

        git am --abort

NOTE: git-patch apply patch content but not commits, hence not
      preserving hisotry (author info or commit messages).

TIP:
    - Always start on a clean working directory (git status should
      show nothing to commit).
    - If the patches were generated from a different repository, make
      sure your base branch matches the one the patches were made
      from.
    - For large patch series, git am is much easier than manually
      applying with git apply.
