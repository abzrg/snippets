Merge base / Most recent common ancestor
----------------------------------------

In Git, the parent commit of a branch that was branched off from
another branch is commonly referred to as the "merge base" between the
two branches.

More specifically:
- The merge base is the most recent common ancestor commit of two
  branches.
- It's the commit where the two branches diverged.
- When you create a new branch from another branch, the commit you
  branched off of becomes the merge base between the two.

Example:

Let's say you have this commit history:

    A---B---C (main)
             \
              D---E (`feature`)

- Commit C is the merge base of `main` and `feature`.
- `feature` was branched off of `main` at commit C.

Other terms you might hear:
- Base commit: Often used informally or in GUIs (like GitHub) to mean
  the same thing.
- Ancestor commit: A more general term; merge base is the nearest
  common ancestor.


If you want to find the merge base between `main` and `feature`:

    git merge-base main feature

This will return the commit hash of the most recent common ancestor
(i.e. the point where `feature` branched off from `main`).

You can use this in combination with git show to see details of that
commit:

    git show $(git merge-base main feature)
