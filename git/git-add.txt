GIT ADD
=======

-N, --intent-to-add
-------------------

Record only the fact that the path will be added later. An entry for
the path is placed in the index with no content. This is useful for,
among other things, showing the unstaged content of such files with
git diff and committing them with git commit -a.

    git add -N/--intent-to-add new_untracked_file
    git add -p/--patch new_untracked_file
