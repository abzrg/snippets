SSH Authentication (github examples)
==================

- generate key with, optionally a certain <name>

    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<email> or <github-anon-email>" -f <name>

- copy and add it to github as "Authentication" key

    tr -d '\n' < ~/.ssh/<name>.pub | pbcopy

- add the following to ~/.ssh/config

    Host github.com
        HostName github.com
        User git
        AddKeysToAgent yes
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/<name>  # path to private key

- ensure ssh-agent is running and your key is added

    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add -l

- test github ssh connection:

    ssh -T git@github.com

  a successfull response would look something like:

    Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated...


NOTE: If you still get “permission denied”, check file permissions.
SSH requires strict permissions:

    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/<name_of_private_key>
    chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
