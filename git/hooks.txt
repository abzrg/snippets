Hooks
=====

git comes with 28-ish hooks. Most of them are not applicable to most
people and repos. Here are the essential and usefull ones:

commit stuff:
    - pre-commit
    - prepare-commit-msg
    - commit-msg
    - post-commit

rewriting stuff:
    - pre-rebase
    - post-rewrite

merging stuff:
    - post-merge
    - pre-merge-commit

switching/pushing stuff:
    - post-checkout
    - reference-transaction
    - pre-push

examples of things that can be done with hooks:

- commit message formatting
- package install
- update ctags
- submodule status
- tabs or spaces
- linting
- large files
- test passes
- rebasing merged commit prevention

helpers for hooks:

- pre-commit
    brew install pre-commit
    pre-commit sample-config > .pre-commit-config.yaml
    pre-commit install
- husky
    npm install --save-dev husky
    mpx husky init
