rsync
=====

    rsync -avz host:file1 :file1 /dest/
    rsync -avz user@host:file1 :file1 /dest/
    rsync -avz /source host:/dest


-a,--archive
    archive mode; same as -rlptgoD (no -H)
    essentially keeps the file metadata (permission, mtime etc.)

-v,--verbose

-P = --partial --progress -h,--human-readable
    --partial: in case of partial transfer of a file, as a result of a
               transfer interruption, continue where you left off
    --progress: show progress during transfer
    --humna-readable: output numbers in a human-readable format

--delete
    deletes files that are removed locally but exist on the remote
    side. usefull for sync and not for backtup.
--delete-after
    delete to be removed files after transfer is being done, allowing
    you to pause during the transfer in case you cancel out the
    deletion.
--delete-excluded

--exclude=PATTERN
    exclude files matching PATTERN
--exclude-from=FILE
    read exclude patterns from a FILE

-u,--update
    skip files that are newer on the receiver. this is usefull in
    collaborative projects where person A updates file X and person B
    doesn't; after person A transfers his files, the file X of person
    B transfers does not get transfered.


A note about trailing '/':

    A trailing slash on the source changes this behavior to avoid
    creating an additional directory level at the destination. You can
    think of a trailing / on a source as meaning "copy the contents of
    this directory" as opposed to "copy the directory by name", but in
    both cases the attributes of the containing directory are
    transferred to the containing directory on the destination. In
    other words, each of the following commands copies the files in
    the same way, including their setting of the attributes of
    /dest/foo:

        rsync -av /src/foo /dest
        rsync -av /src/foo/ /dest/foo
