src/<project>/py.typed File
===========================

source: https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/

Package maintainers who wish to support type checking of their code
MUST add a marker file named py.typed to their package supporting
typing. This marker applies recursively: if a top-level package
includes it, all its sub-packages MUST support type checking as well.

The py.typed file is a marker file that indicates to type checkers
like mypy that your package comes with type annotations. Without this
file, the type checker won't use the type hints provided by your
package, leading to potential type errors
