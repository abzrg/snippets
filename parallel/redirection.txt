A note about redirection
========================

    parallel echo "hello" > {} ::: file1 file2

The issue with this command is that the '>' redirection happens before
parallel runs, which means '>' only applies to parallel, not to the
individual commands being executed in parallel.

Solutions:

    # 1
    parallel echo "hello" '|' tee {} ::: file1 file2

    # 2
    parallel 'echo "hello" > {}' ::: file1 file2

    # 3 (my favorite)
    parallel echo "hello" '>' {} ::: file1 file2
